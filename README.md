#David-Example-Game
A small JS game example

## Install
### If you have ssh setup:
* git clone git@github.com:bcokert/david-example-game.git
### If you don't:
* git clone https://github.com/bcokert/david-example-game.git
* Enter Git Login

## How to Use
* Open page.html in a browser to "Run" the game

## Structure
* code.js - holds the "logic" of the game. Any user interaction should be setup here, as well as dynamic changes.
* graphics.css - holds the "appearance" of the game. Like regular css, this defines the appearance, but NOT the structure of your page.
* page.html - holds the "structure" of the game. Like regular html, this defines the structure, but NOT the appearance of your page.

Use page.html to add things like "windows", "objects", "ui zones", etc.
Use graphics.css to define how those things look.
Use code.js to change those things, add new things, and do whatever else dynamically.
